So in this was the game I worked on for the fourth game Jam I organized for my game development meetup. This was a really interesting project to work on… The theme for the game jam was "Tiny World", so basically had to make a game dealing with something tiny. The biggest problem I think our team encountered was thinking of good ideas, in the end we did manage to come up with something good.

Essentially the point of the game is you were some sort of creature having to forge for food and for some reason you had to pull a bolder… So it ended up being a type of tug-a-war mechanic… You had to quickly grab the bolder by moving from left to right with the arrows before the enemy grabs it and runs away. The game jam lasted about 6 hours but I think turned out pretty good for what it was… Great starting point for a possibly cool game.
